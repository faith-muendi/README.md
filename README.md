## 🛡️ About Me

I'm a hands-on cybersecurity professional with a passion for both offensive and defensive security. I specialize in:

- 🔍 Web App Pentesting (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, IDOR)
- 🔐 Security Monitoring & Threat Detection (Splunk, ELK, Security Onion)
- 🧪 Malware Analysis in sandbox environments
- 🧰 Tools: Burp Suite, ZAP, Suricata, Python, FLARE VM, Zeek

I'm currently building advanced detection rules, reporting real-world vulnerabilities on bug bounty platforms, and applying for entry-level roles in both SOC analysis and ethical hacking.
